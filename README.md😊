 Library Management System 📚
Managing library operations can be challenging, but with SQL, I’ve built a Library Management System to simplify tasks like tracking books, managing members, and monitoring transactions. 💻
🛠️ Key Features:
  Books Management: Add, update, and track book inventory
  Members Management: Keep records of library members and their activities.
  Issue & Return Tracking: Monitor issued books, due dates, and overdue returns.
  Queries for Insights: Identify most issued books, available stock, and member borrowing trends.
💡 Technologies Used:
  SQL (MySQL)
  ER Diagram for database design
  Sample data and queries for real-world scenarios
🌟 Project Highlights:
  Database Schema: Designed an efficient schema to handle books, members, and transactions.
